"""hermes_sync.manifest — writes the per-sync manifest at .argo/sync-manifest.json.

Determinism guarantee
---------------------
The output is fully determined by (upstream_sha, files_touched, exceptions_used, now):

- ``files_touched`` is de-duplicated and sorted before serialisation so that
  differing insertion orders produce identical bytes.
- ``exceptions_used`` is sorted for the same reason.
- ``json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True)`` produces a canonical key order
  regardless of dict insertion order (Python 3.7+ dicts are ordered, but we
  do not rely on that — ``sort_keys`` makes it explicit and stable).
- A trailing newline is always appended so the file is POSIX-compliant and
  ``diff`` output is clean.

Two calls with identical arguments (including the same ``now=`` override) will
always produce byte-identical files.

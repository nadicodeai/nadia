"""hermes_sync.passes.content — in-file content rename pass.

Walks every regular file under a given root directory, detects and skips binary
files and excluded paths, then applies all ``(from, to)`` mappings from
:class:`~hermes_sync.config.RenameConfig` via ``str.replace``.

``skip_contexts`` strategy
--------------------------
Some mapping keys appear inside contexts that must not be rewritten — for
example, a key that is part of an upstream URL like
``https://example.com/old-name/api``.  Naively replacing the entire file
content would corrupt those URLs.

The approach used here:

1. For the current file's content, find *all* regex matches for every
   ``skip_contexts`` pattern and record their ``(start, end)`` byte-offset
   ranges.
2. Split the content into alternating *outside* / *inside* segments based
   on those ranges — the segment boundaries are sorted and merged so that
   overlapping or adjacent protected ranges are treated as one contiguous
   block.
3. Apply ``str.replace`` **only** to the *outside* segments.
4. Re-join all segments (outside-replaced and inside-preserved) in order.

This guarantees that text inside any ``skip_contexts`` match is never
modified, while text outside those matches is transformed normally.

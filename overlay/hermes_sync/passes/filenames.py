"""hermes_sync.passes.filenames — filename-rename pass (T2.3).

Walks the tree under ``root`` **bottom-up** (children before parents) and
renames the *basename* of every regular file whose name contains at least one
mapping ``from`` key.

Traversal strategy
------------------
``Path.rglob("*")`` is *not* used because it does not guarantee bottom-up
order.  Instead we collect every path under ``root`` with ``os.walk`` using
``topdown=False``, which yields directories leaf-first.  For each directory
yielded we process its files (regular files only, not symlinks, not dirs)
before moving on to the parent directory.  This invariant ensures that if T2.4
(the directory-rename pass) runs after us, it never encounters a child whose
new path was already invalidated by a parent rename.

Symlink policy
--------------
Symlinks are **skipped**.  Renaming the symlink itself moves the pointer, not
the target; this is almost never what a rename engine wants.  The policy is
documented and tested (test 10 in ``tests/test_filename_pass.py``).

Mapping application
-------------------
Mappings are already sorted longest-``from``-first by :class:`~hermes_sync.config.RenameConfig`.
We apply them in that order using :func:`str.replace` on the basename.  Because
``str.replace`` replaces ALL non-overlapping occurrences left-to-right in a
single scan, a shorter key that overlaps with a longer key that was already
replaced will naturally find no match (the longer key's region has changed),
preventing double-application.

Skip list
---------
The following directory names (as any path component under ``root``) are
unconditionally skipped, regardless of the exception globs:

* ``.git``
* ``.venv``
* ``.argo``
* ``__pycache__``
* ``node_modules``

Exception globs from ``config.exceptions`` are also checked against the
repo-relative POSIX path (forward slashes) of each candidate file.

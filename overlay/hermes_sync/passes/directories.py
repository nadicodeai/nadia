"""hermes_sync.passes.directories — directory-rename pass.

Walk the source tree **bottom-up** (deepest directories first) so that renaming
a child never invalidates a queued parent path.  For each directory whose
basename contains a mapping ``from`` key:

1. Skip if any component of the repo-relative path is in
   :data:`~hermes_sync.passes._constants.SKIP_DIRS` — this prunes the directory
   itself *and* all descendants of skip dirs (e.g. ``.git/foo/`` is not
   renamed even though ``foo`` is not in the skip set).
2. Skip if the repo-relative path matches any exception glob
   (:meth:`~hermes_sync.config.RenameConfig.matches_exception`).
3. Skip symlinks — renaming a symlink rather than its target would silently
   alter the link's meaning.  Real target directories are handled via their
   own traversal entries.
4. Compute the new name by applying each mapping in order (longest-``from``
   first, already guaranteed by :class:`~hermes_sync.config.RenameConfig`).
5. If the target path already exists, raise
   :class:`~hermes_sync.errors.RenameConflictError`.  No merging, no overwriting.
6. Otherwise rename atomically via :meth:`pathlib.Path.rename`.

Returns a :class:`list` of the **new** paths for every directory that was
renamed, in the order they were processed (bottom-up).

This pass is designed to run **after** ``ContentPass`` (T2.2) and
``FilenamePass`` (T2.3).  The orchestrator (T2.6) enforces that order.

"""RenameEngine — orchestrates the ordered rename pipeline.

Pass order is mandated by FR-2 and spec § "Resolved Decisions":

  1. ContentPass  — rewrite tokens *inside* files in-place.
  2. FilenamePass — rename file basenames (bottom-up within each directory).
  3. DirectoryPass — rename directory basenames (bottom-up, deepest first).

Running content before filenames prevents a filename rename from
invalidating the path that ContentPass is about to walk.  Running
filenames before directories prevents a directory rename from
invalidating the file paths that FilenamePass still needs to visit.

Return type
-----------
:meth:`apply` returns ``list[Path]``.  Every element is an **absolute**
:class:`~pathlib.Path` so callers can pass the list directly to
:class:`~hermes_sync.manifest.ManifestWriter` without any path arithmetic.
The list is sorted and deduplicated (a path cannot appear in more than one
pass result because each pass operates on a different dimension: content vs
filename vs directory name).

class RenameEngine:
    """Orchestrates the ordered rename passes over a source tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config:
        Loaded, validated :class:`~hermes_sync.config.RenameConfig`.

        """Run content → filenames → directories; return all touched paths.

        Executes the three rename passes in the order that preserves
        correctness (FR-2):

        1. :class:`~hermes_sync.passes.content.ContentPass` — rewrites tokens
           inside file contents and returns the absolute paths of files whose
           on-disk bytes changed.
        2. :class:`~hermes_sync.passes.filenames.FilenamePass` — renames file
           basenames and returns the new absolute paths of renamed files.
        3. :class:`~hermes_sync.passes.directories.DirectoryPass` — renames
           directory basenames (deepest first) and returns the new absolute
           paths of renamed directories.

        The three result sets are unioned, sorted, and deduplicated before
        being returned.  Sorting uses the natural ``Path`` ordering (which
        on all platforms is lexicographic on the string representation).

        Parameters
        ----------
        root:
            Absolute path to the root of the source tree.  Must exist.

        Returns
        -------
        list[Path]
            Sorted, deduplicated list of absolute :class:`~pathlib.Path`
            objects representing every file or directory whose content or
            name changed.  An empty list means the tree was already fully
            renamed (idempotency, AC-3).

        Raises
        ------
        hermes_sync.errors.RenameConflictError
            Re-raised from :class:`~hermes_sync.passes.filenames.FilenamePass`
            or :class:`~hermes_sync.passes.directories.DirectoryPass` if a
            rename target already exists.
        hermes_sync.errors.ConfigError
            Should not occur here (config is validated at load time), but
            propagates if the config object is somehow invalid.
